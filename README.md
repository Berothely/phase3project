Customer Churn Prediction
<hr>
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecom company.
Churn — the phenomenon of customers discontinuing a service — is a critical business problem in industries where long-term customer retention drives profitability.
Using customer behavior and service data, this project applies machine learning techniques to identify customers at risk of leaving, with the goal of supporting proactive retention strategies.

⚙️ Methodology
The notebook follows a complete data science workflow:
1.	Business Understanding – framing churn as a profitability issue.
2.	Data Exploration & Cleaning – handling missing values and imbalances.
3.	Preprocessing & Feature Engineering – encoding categorical variables, scaling, and resampling.
4.	Modeling – Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
5.	Hyperparameter Tuning – RandomizedSearchCV with Stratified K-Fold cross-validation.
6.	Evaluation – accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
7.	Interpretation – coefficients (Logistic Regression) and feature importance (Random Forest).
